# coops second brain template
this is a template i made for obsidian so i can stay organised.

# usage
when you clone the repo, you are going to want to delete all of the "tmp" notes, they are only there so the folders don't get excluded by git.

one you open the template with obsidian, you should see the home page, it is your entry point into the system.

## the note inbox
the note inbox is where you can view the newly created notes, so if you needed to jot down something quickly, you can access it easily later and put it where it needs to go.

## the task inbox
this is where tasks with the #task or #canDo tag would be, you would be able to go to the note it is in, or directly complete it.
- [ ] #task it should look like this in any note

when you create a project, there is a section where you specify goals in the form of tasks, you can use this to specify what tasks you want to show up on the homepage, that's why there is also a #canDo tag.
## the areas
this is the section where you can view the areas you created, you can create one by clicking "New Area".

once you create a new area, fill out the template. the overview section is where you explain what the area is and what it is used for.

then you would be able to create projects for that area, you would have to make sure you link the project to the area you want it to be linked to, it doesn't do it automatically.
## the other resources
this is the section where you see resources that are not associated with an area, you can create one by clicking "New Resource".

once you create a resource you can link it to an area by setting area to the file name of the area you want to link it to. then fill out the template. the overview section is where you explain what the resource is and its purpose.

## the ideas
this is a section iv'e added that is a different type of resource that uses a special template for you to jot down any world changing idea you have! create one by clicking "New Idea".

then you would be able to fill out the template, you can also link it to a area and it would show up as a resource.
